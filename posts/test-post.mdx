President Biden has nominated Judge Florence Y. Pan to a seat on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.

In 2021, Pan took Ketanji Brown Jackson’s seat on the U.S. District Court for D.C. when Jackson, now headed to the U.S. Supreme Court, became an appellate judge. Now Pan is being nominated for Jackson’s appellate court seat.

Both women were elevated as part of a concerted push by the Biden administration to add more women and people of color to the federal bench. Another Biden nominee to the D.C. Circuit, Judge J. Michelle Childs of South Carolina, had her confirmation hearing last month. Pan would be the first Chinese American woman on the appellate court, according to the National Asian Pacific American Bar Association.

A.B. Cruz III, acting president of the National Asian Pacific American Bar Association, in a statement called Pan “a leader in the Asian Pacific American community” with “a stellar record.”

Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D.C.) said in a statement that Pan “brings much-needed diversity to the federal circuit courts, especially at a time when Asian Americans are being attacked.”
